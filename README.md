# AI-Generative

AI-Generative is a web application that allows users to interact with an AI model by sending queries and receiving responses. This project is built using React and demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and handle user input.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Users can enter queries using a text input field and submit them by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "GENERATE" button/Icon.
- **Response Display**: Responses from the AI are displayed in a dedicated response frame, including messages and code snippets.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can easily copy code snippets to their clipboard.
- **Typing Animation**: The application features a typewriter effect for a dynamic greeting message.

## Technologies Used

- **Next Js**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For application logic and interactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Backend**: use Spring Boot & Spring AI.
